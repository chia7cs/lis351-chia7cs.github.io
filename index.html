		<p> Hello World! Apa khabar? My name is Chia and I speak Malay, Chinese, English, Teochew, and Hokkien. I am immensely grateful for being able to live in a beautiful, diverse, and multicultural country called Malaysia. 
			I love sharing Malaysian food with my friends in America and sometimes invite them over to make traditional desserts together. We make ‘ondeh-ondeh’ which is a traditional dessert made with pandan (screwpine leaf) infused dough and filled with Gula Melaka or palm sugar. 
			I look forward to sharing the uniqueness of Malaysia with more people at UW-Madison. I am currently a Junior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering. 
			Here is a little more about me. By clicking the hyperlinks, you would be able to find my favourite food, and also the places I have travelled!
