		<p> Belgium is a small country in Europe that is often overlooked by travelers in favor of its larger and more famous neighbors, like France and Germany. However, I recently had the chance to explore this charming country and was pleasantly surprised by what it had to offer.

		My trip began in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. The city is known for its stunning architecture, vibrant nightlife, and delicious cuisine, so I was excited to see what it had in store. I started by visiting the famous Grand Place, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is often considered one of the most beautiful squares in Europe. The ornate guildhalls and towering Town Hall were truly breathtaking, and I couldn't help but marvel at the intricate details and stunning beauty of the square.

		After admiring the Grand Place, I made my way to the nearby Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue of a little boy urinating. While it may seem like an odd attraction, the statue is actually a symbol of the city's irreverent sense of humor and playful spirit. From there, I wandered through the charming streets of the historic center, stopping at local cafes and shops to sample some of the city's famous waffles and chocolates. </p>
